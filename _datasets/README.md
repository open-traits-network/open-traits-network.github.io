# Dataset Registration Process

The dataset registration process is as follows:

1. contributor opens a "register dataset" github issue via https://github.com/open-traits-network/open-traits-network.github.io/issues/new/choose
2. contributor fills out the dataset registration form provided in the dataset registration issue template. This template is managed at [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/register-dataset.md](../../../tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/register-dataset.md) 
3. contributor submits the issue
4. OTN editor [self-assigns](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users) the issue to indicate to others the they are working on it.
5. OTN editor reviews the registration request, asking for information if needed via issue.
6. on approval, OTN editor creates a new dataset file and commits/pushes the changes to the OTN registry repository.
7. OTN editors verifies that the new addition is accessible via https://opentraits.org .
8. OTN editor notifies contributor via issue comment and includes a OTN link to the new addition.
9. OTN editor closes issue

If you'd like to improve the registration process, please open an issue and make suggestions. 

# Creating a dataset file

To create a new dataset file, re-use the template via an issue provided through the data registration process, including the three dashes at the top and bottom of the text. Next, go to the top of the page and click `Create new file` which is located on the top right, second menu down. Paste the copied text into the large textbox and fill in the information as per the instructions below. Leave a space after the colon on each line. Enter the same `id` in the small textfield at the top (the web link), which is the abbreviate dataset name in [kebab-case](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase) with dashed instead of spaces in lowercase (e.g. coral-traits, globi). Add `.md` as the extension to the new dataset file (e.g. test-id.md). 

If you don't have an issue to start from, please see [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/register-dataset.md](../../../tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/register-dataset.md) for required fields.

You can also inspect existing datasets above.
