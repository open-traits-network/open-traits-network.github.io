description: The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) aims to provide an authoritative and comprehensive list of names of marine organisms, including information on synonymy. Within WoRMS, a series of traits are being documented on a continuous basis from literature. Traits can be documented at the species level, but also at the higher taxonomic levels, and then inherited to the species level. All traits in WoRMS can be searched through the Marine Species Traits sub-register.
taxaList: More than 240.000 marine accepted species.
usefulClasses: Literature-based trait information for marine species.
