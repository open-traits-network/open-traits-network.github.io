description: The Octocoral Trait Database is a growing compilation of octocoral life history traits, phylogenetic relationships, and biogeographic data. This dataset extends the Coral Trait Database, which focuses on scleractinian corals, by incorporating data for over 3,500 species of octocorals. As of today, the database contains over 97,500 trait observations and more than 100,000 trait entries across 128 traits—30 of which are contextual. These entries cover species from shallow waters to the deep sea.
