Anton is a soil ecologist focused on invertebrate food webs

## Collaboration statement
I like the idea of open and standardised trait space across projects and taxa. I working with invertebrate traits, trophic and morphological. We're developing Ecotaxonomy virtual research environment (http://ecotaxonomy.org), where we can link traits and other attributes to taxa and observations. 

I can code only in R and don't do IT development by myself. Nevertheless, I would be happy to support initiative by developing trait vocabularies, tools and linking different platforms together. I coordinating several initiative, primarily focused on compilation of trophic traits for soil invertebrates at the moment. Ecokeys, that are developed in Ecotaxonomy framework, is a flexible tool that allow to create identification key for any group and region, based on morphological traits.
