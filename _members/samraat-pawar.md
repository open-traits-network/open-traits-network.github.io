Samraat is a theoretical/quantitative ecologist based at the Silwood Park Campus of Imperial College London, UK. 

## Collaboration statement

My lab studies whether and how metabolic constraints on individual organisms scale up to complex ecological systems (AKA ecosystems), using  trait-based mathematical and computational modelling.

I am one of the co-founders of [BioTraits](https://ecologicaldata.org/wiki/global-biotraits-database) and its spin-off, the [VecTraits](https://legacy.vectorbyte.org/vectraits) (both currently being overhauled) databases. I offer expertise in workflows for constructing metabolic trait-focused databases. I am  currently particularly interested in microbial metabolic traits (in an ecological context), and within that, thermal responses of these traits. 

I am keen on helping strengthen trait-based ecology in general. I am particularly keen on discussing the possibilities of developing a global trait standard and database for "ecological metabolic traits" (starting with a discussion of how to define this particular thing *per se*!), and am happy to support the Open Traits resource in any way that I can.

I am currently (2025) working as a co-PI on the [One Health Vector-Borne Diseases Hub](https://vbdhub.org), which builds upon VecTraits.
