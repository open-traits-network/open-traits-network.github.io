Hao Ran is a plant ecologist from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia based in Christchurch, New Zealand. 

## Collaboration statement
I work on trait-based species distribution and demographic models, focusing mostly on plants but expanding to plant-animal interactions. My primary open trait dataset is the upcoming SGtraits - a curated dataset on the traits of Singapore flora. This resource was created courtesy of the traits.build R package.

I can offer expertise in building statistical modelling, especially complex GLMMs. I am also happy to help connect people together around traits by running working groups, hosting visitors in my institute, organising symposia at conferences and maintaining our Open Traits website. In particular, I am keen to expand the network to the Tropical Asian region and build local capacity.
