Am√©lie is a stream ecologist based in Uppsala, Sweden. 

## Collaboration statement
I have a long-standing interest in ecosystem functioning in streams under anthropogenic pressures. I am working on gathering intraspecific body sizes of aquatic organisms, which I use to assess ecological resilience.

I can offer expertise in macroinvertebrate and fish traits. I would be very happy to connect with people working on traits in any means (visits, working groups, etc).
