FRED!

## Collaboration statement

I am passionate about plant and ecosystem science. I also believe that the success of ongoing efforts to understand how plants function in contemporary environments and will respond to future perturbations will be dependent on willingness by the community to support each other’s efforts and openly share our knowledge and precious data. I am open to sharing my expertise in fine-root research, actively contribute data to the Fine-Root Ecology Data (FRED), and encourage similar contributions to freely available data repositories as well constructive dialog among researchers.
